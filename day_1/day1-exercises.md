1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
> HTML provides structure for a readability. Additionally, it allows visitors to move from one page to another with links included. Then the text can be further annotated so create a layered and more meaningful document.


2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
> An element exists inside angled brackets. The content between the opening and closing and the opening and closing tags themselves are all considered an HTML element. Tags are what type of opening & closing tags are being used and thus provides additional information to the browser how the content should be displayed. The Tags are the bread in a sandwich where as a sandwich is a sandwich when you have the bread plus everything else inside.


3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
> Attributes provide supplemental information about the tags being used. This supplemental information will allow the browser to apply a more specific display and interactive page.


4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
> The head element contains meta information that can help browsers be aware of what information your page contains. The title element is what appears at the top of a web browser tab and gives the user context of the page they are about the view. The body element is everything that will be displayed inside of the main browser window. The distinction and use of these three different elements create a structure that the browser easily interpret and create a readable display for the user.


5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
> There are two ways to view the source of chrome on a mac. Either press opt+command+u or under __view__ section of your menu, go to __developer__ area and then click __view source__.


6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

> 1. `<blockquote>` allows a quotation the size of a paragraph to be indented and provide visual awareness that the voice of the author is no longer the same. For screen readers, this provides additional information to be provided with those users that simply indenting a quote via CSS.
> 2. `<em>` provides a subtle change of tone by shifting the emphasis, usually visually expressed in italics.
> 3. `<abbr>` allows for the developer to input the technical term or full term but the abbreviation or acronym is presented unless the user pans their mouse over the word.
> 4. `<s>` is visually represented by being struck through, imply that the information is outdate, inaccurate, or irrelevant, but still shouldn't be deleted. Good for showing the sale prices compared to the retail price.
> 5. `<sup>` creates a suffix that can be beneficial for citing, dates, or mathematical concepts.


7.  What are empty elements?
> Empty elements are elements that combine the opening and closing tag so that it is expressed with an opening angle bracket, the tag, a space, a forward slash, and then a closing angle bracket.
> Examples include the paragraph break(`<br />`) and the line break (`<hr />`) elements.

8.  What is semantic markup?
> Semantic markup are tags that don't affect the structure of the page, but provide supplemental information that can especially useful in regards to accessibility. This includes `<strong>` or `<em>`.


9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
> 1. `nav` creates a specific space for navigation to exist.
> 2. `aside` creates either a space for information relation, but nonessential for the article it's nested in or the entire page it belongs.
> 3. `<figure>` & `<figcaption>` create a container for media (images, videos, graphs) or other supportive materials (text, code samples) to be placed into a page while also including a descriptor that will remain in contact with the `<figure>` it is associated with.
