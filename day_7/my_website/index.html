      <h3>Birds & Me</h3>
      <p class="one">My family and I went birding last night. The sun was falling behind the trees, making the lighting difficult. We stood on the edge of the road and looked through our binoculars at a bird sitting on the bare upper branches of a
        tree. It was a
        robin. The large orange belly turned yellow in the setting sun. Another bird. Another look through the binoculars. Another robin. Hundreds and hundreds of robins migrating south for the winter. They weren't settling down to sleep, though. A
        majority of smaller birds migrate at night to protect themselves from predators. Birds have developed hundreds of ways to survive: puffing up their feathers to insulate themselves from the cold; carrying their egg shells away from the nest to
        fool racoons and opossoms </p>

      <h3>Birds & Media</h3>
      <article class="movies">
        <p>What movie stars Jack Black, Steve Martin, and Owen Wilson as the main characters? You won't be surprised to hear it's a comedy. And maybe because you're visiting this website you can take a gander it has something to do with birding.
          But did could you have guessed that hundreds of people participate in the very event that the movie is named after: <em>The Big Year</em>. The big year is an event in which an individual strives to see as many different species of birds as
          possible. And the movie? It is the first movie about birders themselves. <a href="https://www.gregmillerbirding.com/about/" target="_blank">Greg Miller</a> is one of those very birders represented
          in
          the movie rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJARwSNpUP4" target="_blank"><i>The Bird Year</i></a>.
          <br><br>
          Beautiful documentaries provide an inside look into specise from all around the world. Netflix provides a look into the extreme lengths some birds go for love in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6po8dWuvCI" target="_blank">Dancing
            with the Birds</a>. Episodes from <i>Planet Earth</i> highlight the acrobatics of certain species.

      <article class="podcasts">
        <p>But you don't just have to see birds to appreciate them. Birding podcasts focus on the science of birds and the birders themselves. Some of my personsal favorites are:
