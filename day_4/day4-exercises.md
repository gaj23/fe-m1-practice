## Images HTML  
1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?
> The `alt` attribute provides a text description of the image in case the image doesn't load or for a screen reader to convey meaningful information to a user.


2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?
> The placement of an image element is what determines whether it is an inline or a block element. If it is followed by a block element, then it will be displayed on a separate line than the block element. However, if the image is placed __inside__ of a block element, then the image behaves like an inline element and the surronding text and elements will behave accordingly and continue on the same like.


3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
> `JPEG` is best for images with a variety and depth of color. JPEGs are able to best express these nuiances. `PNG` provides the clarity needed in things like logos when flat colors or limited variety of colors are used. Because `JPEG` and `PNG` use the bitmap image format, they allow for files with a lower resolution (recommended 72 ppi) and thus file size to display quickly and with clarity on a website.

## Images CSS  
1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
> When image sizes are controlled via CSS rather than HTML, a page loads better because it anticipates the space needed when an image loads (after HTML & CSS load).


2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
> An image sprite is something that is often used for button manipulation on a page. It is a single image used over and over again and because it is just the one image, that means the browser only needs to send one request for that one image.
